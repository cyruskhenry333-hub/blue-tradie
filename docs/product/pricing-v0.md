## What's an AI Action?

An AI action is a single AI job—like getting a chat reply, drafting an invoice message, classifying an expense, or summarizing a conversation.

### Action Cost Guide

| Action Type | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Short chat reply | ~1 action |
| Long reply (detailed advice) | ~2–4 actions |
| Marketing pack (ad + flyer + FB post + email) | ~4–8 actions |
| Image analysis (1–5 photos) | ~5–15 actions |
| Voice command (intent + tool execution) | ~1–3 actions |

**Note:** STT (speech-to-text) and TTS (text-to-speech) are tracked separately in minutes, not included in action counts.

## Usage Policy

### No Surprise Bills
We don't charge overage fees by default. You won't wake up to a surprise $200 bill.

### 80% Warning
When you hit 80% of your monthly actions, we'll let you know so you can pace yourself.

### At 100%: Your Choice
When you hit your limit, you choose:
- **Basic Mode**: Shorter replies, reduced proactive nudges—keeps working, just lighter
- **Pause**: Stop AI features until your plan resets next month

The app will be clear about what mode you're in. No hidden degradation.

### Future: Overage Packs
We may add optional top-up packs later (e.g., +500 actions for $10), but not required for MVP. You'll always have the choice to just wait for reset.
