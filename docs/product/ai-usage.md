# AI Usage Guide

## What Is AI Usage?

**AI usage = actions.** Every time BlueTradie's AI does something for you—answers a question, drafts a message, analyzes a photo—that's an action.

Your plan includes a monthly allowance of actions. Use them however you want throughout the month.

## Action Examples

| What You Do | Actions Used |
|-------------|--------------|
| Ask a quick question ("What's the GST on $500?") | ~1 |
| Get detailed advice ("Explain BAS step by step") | ~2–4 |
| Generate a marketing pack (ad, flyer, FB post, email) | ~4–8 |
| Analyze job site photos (1–5 images) | ~5–15 |
| Voice command ("Add expense for Bunnings $85") | ~1–3 |

## FAQ

### What counts as an action?
Any time the AI processes something for you:
- Chat replies (short or long)
- Drafting messages, emails, quotes
- Analyzing images
- Classifying expenses
- Generating marketing content
- Summarizing conversations
- Voice command processing

### What doesn't count?
- Viewing your dashboard
- Browsing jobs, invoices, expenses
- Manual data entry (typing in an expense yourself)
- Downloading reports
- Basic app navigation

### What happens at 80%?
You'll get a heads-up notification: "You've used 80% of your AI actions this month." This gives you time to pace yourself or decide if you need to upgrade.

### What happens at 100%?
You choose:
1. **Basic Mode** — AI keeps working but with shorter replies and fewer proactive nudges
2. **Pause** — AI features stop until your plan resets next month

Either way, you stay in control. No surprise charges.

### Why do limits exist?
AI costs money to run. Limits let us:
- Keep prices affordable ($29–$99/mo vs pay-per-use)
- Ensure fair access for all users
- Provide predictable costs for your business

### How can I reduce usage?
- **Be specific**: "GST on $500?" uses less than "Explain everything about GST"
- **Batch tasks**: Generate multiple marketing items in one request
- **Reuse templates**: Save AI-generated content as templates
- **Use proactive nudges**: They're efficient—one action to remind you about 5 overdue invoices

## Voice Usage

Voice features have their own tracking:

### How Voice Works
1. **STT (Speech-to-Text)**: Your voice → text (tracked in minutes)
2. **Intent Processing**: AI understands what you want (~1 action)
3. **Tool Execution**: AI does the task (0–2 actions)
4. **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: Response spoken back (tracked in minutes)

### What's Tracked
| Component | How It's Tracked |
|-----------|-----------------|
| STT minutes | Separate from actions |
| TTS minutes | Separate from actions |
| Voice command itself | ~1–3 actions (intent + execution) |

### Sensitive Actions Require Confirmation
Voice commands that involve:
- Sending messages to customers
- Changing invoice amounts
- Processing payments

...will always ask for confirmation before executing. "Did you mean to send this invoice to John for $2,500?"
