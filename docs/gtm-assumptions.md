# BlueTradie GTM Assumptions

## Positioning

**AI-native business team in your pocket.** BlueTradie gives tradies reactive advisors (ask anything, get answers), proactive advisors (nudges and reminders before you forget), smart automations (things that run themselves), and a full business stack (jobs, quotes, invoices, expenses)—all in one app built for how tradies actually work.

---

## Target Users

### Primary: Solo Tradies Starting Out
- New to running a business
- Low admin/business experience
- Need guidance on tax, invoicing, compliance
- Time-poor, phone-first
- Want to "just do the work" without paperwork headaches

### Secondary: Small Family Business
- Spouse or partner runs admin
- Tradie focuses on jobs
- Need shared visibility across jobs, invoices, calendar
- Want automation to reduce manual work

---

## Region Strategy

**ANZ-first, region-configurable.**

- Start where we can sell fastest: **Australia now**
- Expand to **New Zealand** once AU is stable
- All features built with `REGION` config from day one
- Region affects: GST rates, tax authority (ATO/IRD), currency (AUD/NZD), compliance rules, terminology

## Core Promises

- **Proactive advisors** — Get nudges before things slip (overdue invoices, unfollowed quotes, missing receipts)
- **Reactive advisors** — Ask anything about tax, marketing, pricing, contracts—get tradie-specific answers
- **Automation engine** — Things run themselves (reminders, follow-ups, recurring invoices)
- **Time saved** — Less admin, more billable hours
- **More jobs, more money** — Better follow-up, faster quotes, professional invoices = higher conversion

## What We Will Measure

These metrics let us show real value to tradies (and publish anonymized averages):

| Metric | How We Measure |
|--------|----------------|
| **Time saved per week** | Self-reported + task completion timestamps |
| **Invoices paid faster** | Days from invoice sent → paid (before vs after) |
| **Admin hours reduced** | Time spent in app on admin tasks vs baseline |
| **Lead conversion lift** | Quotes sent → jobs won ratio (once marketing module exists) |

We will publish anonymized averages to help tradies understand the value (e.g., "BlueTradie users get paid 5 days faster on average").
