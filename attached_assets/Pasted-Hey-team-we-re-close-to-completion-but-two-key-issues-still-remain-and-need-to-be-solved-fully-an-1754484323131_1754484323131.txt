Hey team — we’re close to completion, but two key issues still remain and need to be solved fully and properly, not just patched.

Please read this carefully, simulate the entire user journey, and confirm visually and functionally that everything is working as intended.
🟥 1. BUTTON VISUAL CONFIRMATION NOT WORKING

Problem:
The “Activate Your Demo Access” button sends the demo code email correctly — but the user doesn’t see any visual change after clicking. This creates uncertainty.

I’ve tested it in Gmail, and the button does not change even though the backend process fires correctly.
🧠 What I need you to do:

    Simulate a full live test from the user's perspective

    Confirm the actual behavior of the button inside the inbox after it’s clicked

    Check if any part of the JS or interaction is being blocked by Gmail or other major email clients

    Update it so that visibly and functionally, the button:

        Updates its text to: ✅ Demo Access Sent! Check your inbox

        Is disabled after the click

        Changes the background color (green is fine: #10b981)

        Updates the cursor to not-allowed or default

Please ensure this works in a real email environment like Gmail, not just inside the preview or staging.

If Gmail blocks this kind of interactivity, provide me a fallback solution that still offers visual confirmation.
🟧 2. INCORRECT URL IN DEMO EMAIL

Issue:
The demo access email still includes a login link pointing to:
https://bluetradie.replit.app/demo-login

This is NOT the correct domain — we want users going to the public site.
✅ Please update the demo email to say:

    Go to https://www.bluetradie.com
    Click “Demo Login” in the top right corner
    Enter your name, email, and demo code

You don’t need to deep link to the login page — just direct them to the homepage with simple instructions.
🔁 What I Expect From You:

    Simulate a full live test using a real test email (e.g., Kane or ra@ address)

    Validate that all changes are visible, functional, and user-friendly

    If anything is blocked or doesn’t work due to email client limitations, provide a workaround

    Confirm completion only after testing real-world behavior, not just deploying the code

Once those are both resolved and verified, I’ll do one final check and we’re ready to launch.

Thanks!
