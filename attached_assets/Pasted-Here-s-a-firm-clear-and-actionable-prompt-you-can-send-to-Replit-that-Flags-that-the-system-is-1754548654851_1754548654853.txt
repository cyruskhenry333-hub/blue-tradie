Here‚Äôs a firm, clear, and actionable prompt you can send to Replit that:

* Flags that the system is not using the correct templates
* Requests confirmation of **what templates are actually being used**
* Asks where the templates are managed so you can inspect or manage them directly
* Expresses your frustration professionally while keeping the door open for resolution

---

**Prompt for Replit:**

Hey team ‚Äî I need to pause here and get some clarity, because it feels like we‚Äôre going in circles and wasting time and money.

---

### ‚ùå Issues:

1. I **still have not received the Welcome email**, despite the system marking it as sent.
2. The **Day 7 and Day 14 emails are using the wrong templates** ‚Äî they don‚Äôt match the ones we previously created and approved.
3. It looks like these follow-up emails were either created from scratch or pulled from a default/fallback instead of the correct HTML templates.

### üîç What I need to know:

1. **What exact SendGrid templates are being used right now** for:

   * Welcome email
   * Day 7 Follow-up
   * Day 14 Video Request

   Please provide:

   * The **template names**
   * The **SendGrid template IDs**
   * The **file or variable location** in the Replit environment where these are being referenced

2. **Where can I find and edit these templates manually** in the Replit project?

   * I want full visibility over how this is set up
   * I need to know if this is being handled via environment variables, inline HTML, or external API calls to SendGrid

3. **Can I manually trigger and test these emails myself** from the Replit environment?
   If so, please give me the steps or commands to do so.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Note:

This has taken far too long and I‚Äôve spent way too much time and money trying to get a simple automation flow to work the way we originally planned. I‚Äôm not looking for more patches or rewrites ‚Äî I want the system to follow the **exact templates and logic we agreed on**, without deviations.

Please respond with the full technical setup so I can review and make changes directly if needed.

Thanks.
