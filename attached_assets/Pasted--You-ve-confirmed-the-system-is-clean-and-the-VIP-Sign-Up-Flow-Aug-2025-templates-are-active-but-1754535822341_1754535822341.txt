You‚Äôve confirmed the system is clean and the VIP Sign-Up Flow ‚Äì Aug 2025 templates are active, but I just tested the live sign-up and did not receive any email ‚Äî not even the welcome email.

At this point, we need to stop relying on surface-level confirmations and do a full system integrity check across backend logic, triggers, environment configs, and SendGrid integration.
üß† Here's What You Need to Do ‚Äî Step by Step:
‚úÖ 1. Confirm Environment Deployment

    Confirm that the live deployed version of the frontend and backend is in sync with the working version you tested internally.

    Rebuild and redeploy if needed ‚Äî but confirm prod is not pointing to an outdated or disconnected environment.

‚úÖ 2. Confirm Trigger Execution After Form Submission

    Confirm that the POST request from the signup form is:

        Hitting the correct backend endpoint

        Logging the signup correctly in the database

        Triggering the sendWelcomeEmail() or equivalent function as expected

    Add console logs or DB markers if needed and confirm this from a live submission.

‚úÖ 3. Check SendGrid Response per Email Trigger

    Check the SendGrid response for the attempted email send after my signup test. Specifically:

        Was the request made?

        What response status was returned? (202, 400, 403, etc.)

        Was it silently dropped? Suppressed?

        Did the template ID match the VIP Sign-Up Flow ‚Äì Aug 2025 templates?

‚úÖ 4. Verify Template IDs in Code

    Confirm that the template ID being called for the Welcome Email matches the one in the approved August 2025 flow.

    Do not reference fallback templates or defaults that were previously used during testing.

‚úÖ 5. Test with Multiple Real Email Addresses

    Test with at least two different live emails (e.g. Gmail, Outlook).

    Do not use sandbox/test accounts ‚Äî test the full flow from form to inbox using real-world conditions.

‚úÖ 6. Log the Email Send Attempt with Timestamp and Recipient

    When an email is triggered, log:

        Template name / ID

        Recipient email

        Timestamp

        Any errors or suppressions

I want to see exactly what the system thinks it's doing.
üîÅ FINAL STEP: Reset Cyrus + Confirm Live Test Conditions

    Reset Cyrus from the database.

    Trigger a full end-to-end test:

        Submit form

        Log backend execution

        Log SendGrid trigger

        Deliver the welcome email ‚Üí demo email

Once you‚Äôve run a verified live test under production conditions, send me:

    A timestamped console log or screenshot of the SendGrid response

    Confirmation of the email sent with the correct template ID

    Confirmation that the live site is now working as expected

Let‚Äôs lock this down with proper technical verification ‚Äî no assumptions, no half-checks.

Thanks,
Cyrus
