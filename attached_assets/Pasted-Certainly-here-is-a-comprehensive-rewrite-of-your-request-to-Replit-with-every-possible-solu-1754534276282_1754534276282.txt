**TO: Replit ‚Äì URGENT: Welcome Email Not Sending via Live Signup Form**

Hi team,

I‚Äôve tested the **live signup form on [www.bluetradie.com](https://www.bluetradie.com)** multiple times, and the **welcome email is not being received**. This has now been an ongoing issue despite multiple back-and-forths, and we urgently need a resolution.

Please do a full and thorough check of the **LIVE production system** and not a dev or test environment.

### üö® Problem Summary:

* The signup form **submits successfully**.
* No **welcome email** is being received by the user.
* This is happening **on the live site**, not in test environments.
* The issue appears inconsistent or reset-related ‚Äî previously it worked during tests.

---

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED FIXES + FULL DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

Please go through each of the following:

#### 1. **Ensure Correct Email Flow is Active**

* The intended email sequence is the one labeled:
  **`VIP Sign-Up Flow ‚Äì Aug 2025`**
* This flow should include:
  ‚úÖ Welcome Email
  ‚úÖ Demo Access Email
  ‚úÖ Day 7 Email
  ‚úÖ Day 14 Email
* **Ensure no other flows or templates** are accidentally connected.
* Delete any **unused, outdated, or test templates**, but **do not delete live/active templates**.

---

#### 2. **Confirm Correct Triggering Logic**

* The welcome email should be triggered **immediately upon signup**, regardless of whether they request early access or not.
* Check if **any conditions (e.g., ‚Äúif earlyAccess = true‚Äù)** are blocking the welcome email from sending.
* Check whether the logic triggering the email is actually running on **form submission**.
* Test manually whether the handler responsible for email dispatch is being **called successfully**.

---

#### 3. **Verify SendGrid Integration**

* Check that the **SendGrid API key** used in the production system:

  * Is **valid** and currently active.
  * Has **not exceeded any usage quotas** (daily/weekly limits).
  * Has the correct **permissions** to send templated emails.
* Ensure that **IP whitelisting, rate limits**, or **domain suppression** is not preventing email delivery.

---

#### 4. **Check Template Linking**

* Confirm that the **SendGrid template IDs** are correctly referenced in code:

  * `WELCOME_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID` should match the intended welcome template.
  * If there are fallback templates or environment variables, confirm they are properly set.

---

#### 5. **Confirm Working Email Address**

* Test sending the email to multiple addresses (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to rule out:

  * Spam/junk filtering
  * Domain-level blacklisting
  * Delivery rejections (especially for Hotmail or iCloud)
* Add a secondary email (like `support@bluetradie.com`) to receive a CC/BCC for confirmation.

---

#### 6. **Check SendGrid Delivery Logs**

* Look up the test signups (including mine today) and confirm:

  * If the welcome email was **triggered and delivered**, or
  * If it **failed**, was **suppressed**, **blocked**, or **never sent**.
* If it was blocked or dropped, check the **error reason** and share that with me.

---

#### 7. **Review Production vs Test Environment**

* Triple-check that we‚Äôre editing and testing the **live deployed environment**, not a test branch or sandbox.
* I suspect some of the changes made have only been pushed to a dev or test branch and not to production.

---

#### 8. **Check Frontend‚ÄìBackend Connection**

* Ensure the frontend form is actually calling the backend route that:

  * Triggers the user signup logic
  * Registers them as a VIP
  * Triggers the welcome email flow
* Confirm this via **live logs** or console outputs.

---

#### 9. **Test with Manual Trigger**

* Try using the "Send Welcome Email" button in the **email admin dashboard**.

  * If that works, the issue is likely in the trigger logic.
  * If that fails, the issue is likely with the integration or template linkage.

---

### üîÅ Next Steps:

1. Please confirm once you have gone through **each of the above**.
2. Send a live test email to:
   üìß `support@bluetradie.com`
   for **Welcome**, **Demo Access**, **Day 7**, and **Day 14** emails.
3. Reset the current live form to allow me to test again manually once fixed.

Let me know as soon as this has been fully reviewed and resolved on the **live production system**. I'm ready to retest immediately.

Thanks!
Cyrus
