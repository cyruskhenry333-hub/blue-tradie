Goal: Keep the password gate, but show public visitors a friendly Coming Soon message. I should still be able to enter a password to access the full app. Don’t change any backend logic/routes beyond this page.

Requirements

Password Gate Page = Hybrid

Keep the existing password input + “Access Blue Tradie” button.

Above/beside the password box, add a public message (visible to everyone):

Title: We’re putting the finishing touches on Blue Tradie

Body: “We’re in private preview while we upgrade the demo and payments. Public access will open soon.”

Small line: “If you were invited, enter your preview password below.”

Keep branding and current design.

Optional public email capture (toggle by env)

Env: PUBLIC_MESSAGE_WAITLIST_ENABLED (default false).

If true: show a simple email box + button “Notify me when it’s live”.

POST to /api/public-notify (create this endpoint if missing):

Validate email, store to public_waitlist table (email, created_at, ip, user_agent).

Send a simple SendGrid “We’ll let you know” confirmation (use existing SendGrid service).

Show success/failure toast.

If false: hide the email capture UI.

SEO / UX

Add noindex meta on this page while password gate is active.

Keep all current bypass rules (APIs, /health, assets) as they are.

Do not block me once I’ve entered the correct password (session cookie keeps access).

Copy (use this text)

Headline: We’re putting the finishing touches on Blue Tradie

Subtext: We’re in private preview while we upgrade the demo and payments. Public access will open soon.

Invite note (small): If you were invited, enter your preview password below.

Notify (if enabled): Want a heads-up when we open?

Field placeholder: “Enter your email”

Button: “Notify me when it’s live”

Success toast: “Thanks! We’ll email you when we open.”

Error toast: “Couldn’t save that email—try again.”

Acceptance

With ADMIN_PREVIEW_PASSWORD set:

Visiting / shows the Coming Soon message + password box.

Entering the correct password unlocks the full app (demo login, dashboard, Stripe) until session expires.

With PUBLIC_MESSAGE_WAITLIST_ENABLED=true:

Submitting an email creates a DB row and sends a SendGrid confirmation (Status 202).

Provide a 30–60s screen recording showing:

Page with Coming Soon message

(If enabled) email capture → success toast

Password entry → redirect to app

Confirm noindex meta present in the head

Guardrails: Do not change any existing app routes, auth, Stripe, or homepage content other than the password gate page and the optional /api/public-notify endpoint + table.
