ey team — I just attempted to log in through the live demo access again, and I'm still getting a 404 error.

We need to get this resolved now, but please read all the instructions carefully — no assumptions, no speculative fixes, no skipped steps.
❗️Objective:

Ensure that when a user logs in using the demo access form with a valid demo code, they are taken into the onboarding experience of the platform — just like a real user — without hitting a 404 or auth block.
✅ What You Must Do (Please follow this exactly):
1. Use my demo credentials to simulate the entire user experience:

    Full Name: Cyrus Henry

    Email: cyruskhenry333@gmail.com

    Demo Code: Demo14

Walk through the actual live front-end flow as a user would:

    Go to the live demo login page

    Input the above details

    Click submit

    Observe what happens after clicking submit

❗️Do not simulate via backend or dev-only interface — use the public-facing live user flow that external users will experience.
2. If a 404 or error still occurs:

Manually check the following in order:

    ✅ Is the demo code being validated correctly in the backend?

    ✅ Is a session or token being generated to simulate login?

    ✅ Is the route being redirected to the correct page after submission?

    ✅ Does the demo login flow create a temporary authenticated experience?

    ✅ Is there a missing route (e.g. /onboarding or /dashboard) that needs to be defined in the router?

    ✅ Is the demoAccess.ts or related handler completing execution or hitting a redirect block?

    ✅ Are demo users being routed through middleware that expects full authentication and is blocking them?

3. Fix Only What’s Necessary:

Please do not:

    Change global auth

    Rewrite unrelated flows

    Add new features

    Guess the problem

Just fix the demo login flow so that a valid demo code:

    Bypasses full auth

    Starts the onboarding flow

    Allows a seamless demo experience

✅ End Goal:

When a user enters their name, email, and demo code:

    They are taken straight into the onboarding flow

    They can explore and use the app

    No 404, no auth error, no redirect failure

Let me know once you’ve done this full simulation and confirmed it’s working exactly as described. Thanks.
