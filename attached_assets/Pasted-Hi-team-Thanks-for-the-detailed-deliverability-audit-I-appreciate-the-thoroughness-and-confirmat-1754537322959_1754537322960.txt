Hi team,

Thanks for the detailed deliverability audit — I appreciate the thoroughness and confirmation that the domain authentication issue has now been resolved.

However, the core issue still remains unresolved:

    When I submit the live sign-up form, the system is skipping the welcome email, and only the demo access email is being sent.

🔍 Here's what needs to be fixed now:
1. 🔄 Fix the email flow order

    The first email that should be sent immediately after form submission is the:

        Welcome Email from the VIP Sign-Up Flow – Aug 2025

    The Demo Access Email should only be triggered after clicking the CTA button inside the Welcome Email (i.e. the “Activate Your Demo Access” button)

Right now, that logic is broken — it's bypassing the welcome email entirely.
✅ Please confirm and check the following:

    Is sendWelcomeEmail() actually being called on form submission?

        Run a live test and check logs to see if the welcome email is being triggered at all when the form is submitted.

        Log the function call with timestamp and email to confirm.

    Confirm only the Welcome Email is triggered immediately after signup

        Do not send the demo email unless the user clicks the CTA in the Welcome Email.

    Verify the logic in waitlistService.addToWaitlist()

        Ensure the correct function is calling the correct email template (welcome) and not triggering the demo access email too early.

    SendGrid activity logs

        Please provide the SendGrid activity log or console output confirming whether the welcome email is ever triggered at all for recent signups.

🚫 What Should NOT Be Happening:

    The demo access email should not be the first thing the user receives.

    The welcome email must be the entry point into the email flow.

    No email should be created or sent outside of the locked VIP Sign-Up Flow – Aug 2025

Please run another full end-to-end signup test using a real email (e.g. mine), and confirm that:

    The signup triggers only the welcome email

    The demo access email only sends after the CTA is clicked

    Both use the correct templates

Let me know once that’s fully verified. I’ll test again right after.

Thanks,
Cyrus
