Absolutely — here’s a **rewritten version of the escalation prompt**, now including the new issue with the **welcome email text being hidden** again. This version is firm, clear, and structured to **stop over-engineering** and refocus the team on doing **exactly what’s needed** — and nothing more.

### 🚨 TO: REPLIT — STOP. Fix These 3 Issues. No New Changes Until Resolved.

Hey team — we’re now going in circles. You’ve introduced new problems while trying to fix others. It’s time to pause, clean this up, and stop guessing.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (TO FIX ONLY)

---

### 1. ❌ Still Receiving **Both Emails at Once**

This is the core problem I’ve flagged multiple times. The system is **still sending both the welcome email and the demo access email at the same time**.

**Fix:**

* Only send the **welcome email** when a user signs up.
* Only send the **demo access email** *after* the user clicks the button.
* Simulate this with a real inbox (e.g. Kane) and confirm the flow step by step.

---

### 2. ❌ Welcome Email Text is **Hiding or Clipping Again**

This is a **regression** — the welcome email body is now getting **collapsed/hidden** in Gmail again (I’ve already seen this happen previously).

**Fix:**

* Restore a layout where **all text and the button are fully visible by default** in Gmail and other common inboxes.
* Avoid deep nesting, excessive inline styles, or large block elements.
* Test in **real Gmail**, not just preview environments.

---

### 3. ❌ Button Still Doesn’t Visibly Confirm

Even if the email sends after clicking, the **button isn’t changing visually** — so users think nothing happened.

**Fix:**

* The button must:

  * Update text to: **✅ Demo Access Sent!**
  * Turn green: `#10b981`
  * Become disabled
  * Change cursor to `not-allowed`

If Gmail blocks this, use a static message that appears **underneath the button** after it's clicked. Do **not** redirect or open a new page.

---

## ✅ DO THIS:

* [ ] Roll back to the last clean, working version
* [ ] Implement ONLY these three fixes — nothing else
* [ ] Simulate the flow yourself (waitlist signup → inbox → click → demo email)
* [ ] Confirm it works **in Gmail**
* [ ] Send screenshots or a test confirmation

---

## 🚫 DO NOT:

* Add fallback states or multiple visual versions
* Create success pages
* Trigger both emails at once
* Assume it’s working without real-world testing

---

Once this is clean and confirmed working, we can move forward.

Thanks.
