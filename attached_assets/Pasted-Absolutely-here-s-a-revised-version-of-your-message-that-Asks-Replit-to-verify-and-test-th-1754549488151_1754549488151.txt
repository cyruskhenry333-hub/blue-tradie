Absolutely — here’s a revised version of your message that:

* Asks Replit to **verify and test** the actual welcome email from the file
* Ensures they **check the template code itself** for potential issues
* Clarifies the **“Send My Video” bug** in the Day 14 email is related to how the mailto link renders

---

**Prompt for Replit:**

Thanks again for resending the 4 emails using the locked templates.

There are still a few issues that need to be addressed and tested properly:

---

### ❌ 1. **Welcome Email Still Not Received**

I still haven’t received the **Welcome email** — and I’ve thoroughly checked all folders (inbox, spam, filtered, etc.). Nothing is being blocked.

Can you please:

* Re-check **SendGrid delivery logs** for `cyruskhenry333@gmail.com`
* Confirm whether the Welcome email was actually **delivered, bounced, or dropped**
* Open and test the template directly from the file (`server/services/vip-signup-flow-aug2025.ts`, lines 29–171) — is the HTML broken or malformed in a way that would prevent it from sending or rendering?

Please make sure it’s not just being marked as “sent” without a successful SendGrid response.

---

### 🧹 2. **Remove the Phase 2 Reference from Day 14 Email**

Please remove this sentence from the Day 14 email template:

> *“As a bonus, you may be considered for early access to Phase 2 features...”*

We don’t want to mention Phase 2 access at this stage.

Please update the template directly in the code and confirm it’s removed.

---

### 🐞 3. **“Send My Video” Button Bug in Day 14 Email**

The **“Send My Video”** button currently opens a new email, but the **subject line is overlapping with the “To” email address** — it’s malformed and buggy.

Please:

* Review the mailto link in the template code
* Test how it renders when clicked (especially in Gmail and Apple Mail)
* Make sure the **“To” email, subject, and body** are clearly separated and formatted

---

Once these are fixed and tested end-to-end, we should be good to go. Appreciate your help getting this fully polished.
