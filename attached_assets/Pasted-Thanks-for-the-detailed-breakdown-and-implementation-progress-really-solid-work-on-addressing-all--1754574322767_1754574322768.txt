Thanks for the detailed breakdown and implementation progress — really solid work on addressing all the core issues. A few confirmations and next requests:
✅ Confirmed Fixes (To Be Retested)

Edit Job functionality implemented — will test the form handling and backend update shortly

Invoice sending added — will verify email/send logic and button feedback

Dashboard “Jobs This Month” now includes all scheduled jobs — will test with a few varied job dates

“View All” buttons on dashboard now functional — will confirm routes work correctly

    Cache invalidation appears improved — will test by adding/editing data across modules

🔁 Still Needs Confirmation / Testing:

    Re-login flow
    → Please confirm:

    Have you now fixed the issue system-wide, not just for demo logins?

    Is isOnboarded respected on any valid session (demo or real user)?
    I’m still experiencing onboarding flow appearing again after re-login — this was the original bug and must be fully resolved.

    Edit Functionality for Invoices and Expenses
    → You’ve confirmed Edit for Jobs — please clarify:

    Is Edit working for Invoices and Expenses too?

    If not implemented yet, can you confirm ETA or flag if it's a limitation?

    Invoice Sending:
    → Please clarify:

    Is the "send" function using email, link generation, or internal status update only?

    If there’s no email integration yet, add a placeholder message or flag the limitation clearly in UI.

    Client Book Total Value
    → I noticed this wasn’t mentioned in your summary. Can you confirm:

    Is it fixed?

    Is it accurately summing scheduled/completed jobs?

    Is formatting consistent?

📋 Test Checklist for You to Run (before I check):

Login with demo and real users → confirm no onboarding reappears

Create/edit job → confirm edit reflects instantly on dashboard and client book

Create/edit invoice → send invoice and confirm success message

Create/edit expense → confirm dashboard reflects updates immediately

Click all View All and Back to Dashboard buttons → confirm routes are valid

    Check total value field in Client Book → confirm correct summing

🚫 Final Reminder

Once again — please do not add, assume, or patch any extra logic or UI flow unless confirmed.

If something is not working or seems missing, let me know first before building around it. We’re at a polishing phase, so precision and QA are the priority now.

Let me know once the full set is tested and confirmed working. I’ll do a full pass afterward.
