Hey team — thanks for the proposed system. The current automation flow is great and I don’t want to change the mechanics right now.

Please don’t build any new pages or change the credential delivery process.
✅ What I’d like you to do:

Please redesign the content of the welcome email only (the first one users receive after signing up). I want it to feel more personal, exciting, and aligned with the Blue Tradie vibe. Here’s what I want included:
📩 New Welcome Email Content

Subject line suggestion:

    🔧 You're In! Welcome to the Blue Tradie Revolution

Body content:

    Welcome and gratitude:
    A warm thank you for being one of the first 100 to join the vision. Mention they’re helping shape the future of tradie tech.

    Discounts/Perks:
    A reminder of the special offer they've unlocked (based on their tier — e.g. 50% off, bonus tokens, etc.)

    Exciting features to look forward to:
    Include highlights like:

        🧠 AI automation across quoting, invoices, and job management

        🔍 Tradie directory

        📱 Offline-ready mobile experience

        🎙️ Voice-to-text tools

        🤖 Smart AI agents (Business, Marketing, Legal, Accounting)

        💬 Instant support coming soon

    Activation section (reworded CTA):
    Frame it like this:

        "Can’t wait for all 100 signups to go live? Want to dive in now and help us test?
        Great — we can hook you up early. Just click below to activate your demo access."

    CTA Button: Activate Your Demo Access

    Disclaimer / Transparency Note:
    Please add a casual, honest line like:

        “This is a live trial demo — things may break, features might change, and we’re still ironing things out. But we’ve worked hard to make this as smooth as possible. If Blue Tradie becomes a full subscription platform, we’ll be adding more robust security and tighter access controls.”

    Visual polish:
    Keep the branding sharp, clean layout, mobile-friendly, with friendly tone and Aussie flavour.

Let me know if you want me to provide final copy or tweak anything — but for now, this is just a request to update the content of the existing welcome email only.

Thanks!
