Hey team — we’re restructuring the launch flow and need to make the following frontend changes to remove the visible beta system and direct users into a simple waitlist-first approach.
🔧 TASKS:
1. 🚫 Remove or hide all beta-related UI elements and routes

Please disable or comment out the following from both the homepage and navigation:

    🔵 The "🎉 Beta is now live!" banner at the top (see Screenshot 1)

    🟢 The Beta signup block under the hero section (showing spot count and tier info)

    🔴 The entire "100 Beta Spots. 3 Tiers..." pricing grid (Screenshot 2)

    🔵 The "Claim Your Spot Now" CTA block (Screenshot 3)

    🔴 The "Early Access Special" section at the very bottom (Screenshot 7)

    NOTE: All these components are part of the beta testing flow and need to be completely removed from both desktop and mobile versions.

2. ➕ Add a "Join the Waitlist" button in the Hero Section

Please add a new button directly beside (or just under) the current “Get Started” and “See Features” buttons in the Hero block. (See Screenshot 1)

    🟡 Label: Join the Waitlist

    🔗 Destination: /waitlist (or whatever the waitlist route is)

    📍 Placement: Same styling and layout as existing buttons. Preferably to the right of "See Features", or on a new line beneath both buttons if needed for mobile responsiveness.

3. 🚫 Hide the pricing section titled "Choose Your Business Platform"

(See Screenshot 6)

    This section shows the Blue Lite, Blue Core, and Blue Elite plans

    Please remove or comment out the entire pricing block from the homepage for now

    We'll reintroduce it later when the paid beta launches

4. 🧭 Optional: Adjust Navigation Bar

    Remove or comment out “Pricing” from the top nav bar

    Keep “Features”, “Roadmap”, and “Login” active

🧼 Final Notes:

    Make sure all removed elements don’t leave empty space or broken layout

    If possible, keep the removed components available in a hidden state so we can re-enable them later

    We’re preparing to reintroduce tiered paid access once the waitlist hits 100+ users

Let me know when these changes are live or if anything needs clarification.
