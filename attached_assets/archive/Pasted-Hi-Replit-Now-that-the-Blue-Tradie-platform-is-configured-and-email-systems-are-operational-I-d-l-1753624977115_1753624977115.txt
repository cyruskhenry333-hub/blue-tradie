Hi Replit,

Now that the Blue Tradie platform is configured and email systems are operational, Iâ€™d like to ensure that the entire user journey is fully functional before launching the beta publicly.

Please run a complete end-to-end simulation of all core user-facing routes, actions, and flows using the breakdown you previously shared. Specifically:
âœ… Simulate the Following Test Cases:

ðŸ§ª Beta Signup Flow

    Attempt signup via /beta with valid invite code BETA123

    Expect: redirect to /onboarding â†’ completion of onboarding â†’ welcome email triggered

ðŸ§ª Onboarding & Goals

    Fill out all onboarding fields: business name, trade, location, GST, etc.

    Proceed to /goals and simulate goal setting

    Expect: goals saved to DB, AI-generated vision board shown

ðŸ§ª Dashboard Navigation

    Visit / dashboard after onboarding

    Confirm all widgets and metrics render correctly

    Interact with: create job, invoice, expense, chat AI buttons

ðŸ§ª Job Management

    Simulate creating a job in /jobs

    Edit job â†’ change status â†’ create invoice from job

    Expect: job data saved, linked invoice generated

ðŸ§ª Invoicing

    Simulate creating invoice manually

    Use AI auto-fill for line items

    Expect: proper GST applied, PDF option visible

ðŸ§ª Expenses

    Add an expense in /expenses with category and GST selected

    Link to a job (if possible)

    Expect: expense saved, displayed in expense list

ðŸ§ª AI Chat Agents

    Simulate chatting with all 4 agents in /chat/:agentType

    Test: Accountant, Legal, Marketing, Business Coach

    Expect: unique responses, persistent message history

ðŸ§ª Profile & Settings

    Update business name and logo in /profile

    Change tone settings and GST config in /settings

    Expect: changes saved, settings persist after refresh

ðŸ§ª Welcome Modal + Tour

    Trigger country-specific welcome modal

    Run through guided 14-step tour

    Expect: all steps work without breaking navigation

ðŸ§ª Email Automation

    Ensure welcome emails were triggered properly per tier

    Simulate 7-day testimonial email trigger (if possible)

Please:

    Verify all buttons, links, and forms function without 404 or frontend errors

    Confirm all data saves to the database

    Report any missing UI elements or broken flows

    Flag any features that appear incomplete or improperly connected

Once this test run is complete, Iâ€™ll do a live dummy test myself to validate from the frontend. Let me know your findings and any areas needing attention before we onboard real users.

Thanks!
