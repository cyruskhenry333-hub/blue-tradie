Hey Replit team 👋

While you’re working on the tiered onboarding system for our first 100 Blue Tradie users, I wanted to make sure we’re setting ourselves up for the best possible beta launch.

Here are a few things I’ve been thinking about — could you let me know which of these we already have implemented, what you recommend, and if there’s anything else you think we should consider?

    Tier-Based Email Sequences
    Do we have tier-specific onboarding emails for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 users? (e.g., different welcome messaging or setup guidance based on the offer they received?)

    In-App Feedback Loop
    Is there a plan for lightweight user feedback inside the app — maybe a “Got feedback?” button or periodic micro-surveys?

    Onboarding Checklist UI
    Do we have a persistent setup checklist or progress bar inside the dashboard to guide new users through essential first steps?

    Testimonial Flow
    Are we collecting testimonials from our early users — either automatically (via email after X days) or through a visible CTA in the UI?

    Mobile Optimization
    Is the full user flow optimized for mobile (especially onboarding, invoices, and interacting with AI agents)?

    Waitlist System Prep
    Once the 100 spots are filled, do we have a waitlist sign-up page with optional engagement touchpoints (like sneak peeks or feature voting)?

    Public Roadmap or Feature Voting
    Would it make sense to add a public Notion-style roadmap or simple upvoting system to let users know what’s coming and give feedback?

    Welcome from Founder Video
    Could we embed a 60-second selfie-style welcome video from me in the onboarding experience or emails to build more trust?

    Pricing & Feature Anchoring
    Do we have early messaging in place that helps users understand the value of Blue Tradie compared to what else is out there?

I want this to be a tight, smooth beta that makes our users feel like they’re part of building something special. What are your thoughts? Is there anything else you think we can do to make this rollout a success?

Appreciate all your input
