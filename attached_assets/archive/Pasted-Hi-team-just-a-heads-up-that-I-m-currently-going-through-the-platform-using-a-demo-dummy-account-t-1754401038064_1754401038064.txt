Hi team — just a heads-up that I’m currently going through the platform using a demo/dummy account to simulate the real 14-day trial experience that users will go through.

I want to flag several things that don’t appear to be working, and also ask that these features be properly tested and verified on your end — I’m finding myself repeatedly having to double-check fixes or features that should already be functional, which is becoming frustrating and time-consuming.
⚠️ Issues Found During Demo Simulation:

    Token Counter Displays 2,000 Instead of 1,000,000

        This should show 1 million tokens for demo users — currently it displays 2,000.

        Please confirm that demo accounts are correctly assigned the full 1M token allocation.

    “Set Your Goals & Vision” Doesn’t Register as Complete

        After submitting my goals/vision:

            The checklist item does not get marked as complete

            The section under “Quick Glance at Your Business” labeled “Set Your Business Goals” remains untouched

        Please clarify: are “Set Your Goals & Vision” and “Set Your Business Goals” meant to be the same function? If so, they’re not syncing properly.

    “Complete Your Profile” Checklist Item Doesn’t Work

        I uploaded a logo, but it didn’t update visually

        The checklist didn’t register it as complete

        Please test this flow to ensure it works end-to-end

    Invoice Creation Isn’t Functional

        Attempting to create an invoice doesn’t do anything

        No draft, no response, no error

    AI Chat Agent Doesn’t Work

        Tried chatting with the AI agent and got no response or visible interaction

🙏 Request:

Can you please simulate the actual user journey from a demo account, test these items directly, and confirm that they work as expected?

I’d really appreciate not having to catch broken flows that should be testable internally — especially during such a critical stage of rollout.

Please let me know once these have been reviewed and fixed. Happy to test again when things are fully functional.

Thanks.
