Hey team — before we move forward with any changes, can you please give me a comprehensive breakdown of everything related to the beta testing system?

Please don’t leave anything out. I want a full overview of:
1. Beta Tier Structure

    What tiers currently exist (names, internal references)?

    What is the intended purpose or feature scope of each tier?

    Is this tied to any pricing logic or token system?

2. Signup & Assignment Flow

    How does a user enter the beta testing system?

    How is their tier determined (manually assigned, user-selected, auto-detected)?

    What routes, components, and database logic are involved in the signup process?

    What happens after a user signs up? (e.g. redirects, flags, stored metadata)

3. Access Control & Permissions

    What features or sections are currently gated by tier?

    What does Tier 1 have access to vs Tier 2 and Tier 3?

    Are there any backend checks or frontend conditionals tied to beta status?

    Are discounts or special offers applied based on tier?

4. UI/UX Display Logic

    Are there any visible indicators that reflect a user’s tier?

    Is there any tier-specific messaging, banners, or instructions?

    Do users experience different UI components based on tier?

5. Database & Backend

    What fields or flags are stored in the database to represent beta tier?

    Are these values reliably used throughout the platform?

    Are there any related triggers, webhooks, or automation tied to tier assignment?

6. Testing Status & Known Issues

    Which parts of the beta system are confirmed working right now?

    Are there any known bugs, inconsistencies, or gaps in logic?

    Are there any leftover components or deprecated code from previous beta iterations?

7. Dependencies or External Systems

    Is the beta system linked to any third-party services, payment systems, or AI agents?

    Do any other systems rely on tier data?

We’ll be restructuring or potentially removing parts of this system, so it’s important we have a full picture of the current state. Please confirm everything that’s live, functional, and connected — and anything that still needs testing or cleanup.

Thanks!
