Thanks — the token count has finally updated to 1,000,000 ✅
Appreciate the clarity around the dynamic user ID issue and the API call interval.

That said, some new and recurring problems have now appeared after your update:
🔧 1. Goals Marked Complete… Without Me Doing It

It looks like the platform auto-marked my goals as completed — I didn’t even fill anything in. Likely triggered after the database fix.

    This is confusing and defeats the purpose of the checklist milestone.

    There should be an option to edit goals at any time — users should never feel locked out or stuck with old info.

Please make sure goals are only marked complete after actual user input — and allow users to revise them later.
🖼️ 2. Logo Upload Still Not Working

    Uploading my logo did nothing — no visual confirmation, and the checklist did not update.

    Please test and confirm that both frontend and backend logic is registering logo uploads properly.

This is now the third time this feature has been marked fixed without actually working.
🧠 3. Remove “Generate With AI” from Logo Upload Card

This option shouldn’t appear here — that’s meant to be part of the AI Branding Wizard, not the logo upload card.
Please remove this to avoid confusion and feature overlap.
🤖 4. AI Chatbot Text Still Boring and Robotic

We had already fixed this once — but the current message looks like the old generic fallback. This is what I’m getting:

    To better assist you, I need a bit more context about your current situation. Are you looking to set goals for your trade business…

It continues in a long paragraph with zero formatting, way too formal and dry.

Please update this with:

    Friendly, engaging tone

    Emojis instead of asterisks

    Shorter, readable chunks

    Clear prompts or actions the user can take next

Let me know if you want me to rewrite that section — happy to provide a refreshed version.
🚨 Final Note:

Please test the frontend behavior yourself before marking these as resolved. Each time I double-check, I find that the “fix” didn’t actually work. That’s now adding to frustration and delays.

Looking forward to the next update. Let me know when everything above is live and tested.

Let me know if you want me to rewrite the AI chatbot response text to send them directly.
