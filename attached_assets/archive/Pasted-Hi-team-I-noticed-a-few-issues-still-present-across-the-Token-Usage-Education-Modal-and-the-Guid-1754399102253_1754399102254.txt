Hi team — I noticed a few issues still present across the Token Usage & Education Modal and the Guided Tour step (5 of 15). Here's a detailed breakdown of the problems and what needs fixing:
🔧 1. Incorrect Token Pricing – Token Usage Modal (Main Dashboard)

Location:
➡️ Dashboard → Click on “Tokens” (top right) → Token Modal

Problem:
The modal currently shows:

Quick question (5 tokens)        $0.200000 NZD  
Invoice advice (12 tokens)       $0.480000 NZD  
Business planning (30 tokens)    $1.200000 NZD  

This is wildly inaccurate.

Fix:
Use actual GPT-4o-mini pricing + 20% markup (rounded for clarity):

    1 token ≈ $0.00000182 AUD → 30 tokens ≈ $0.00005 AUD

Suggested display options:

    Either show accurate costs with simplified decimals:

        Business planning (30 tokens): ~$0.00005 AUD

    Or just replace with simple language:

        "Most tasks cost less than 1 cent."

🧠 2. Overwhelming Cost Detail – Too Many Decimals

Location:
➡️ Same Token Modal (bottom of pricing section)

Problem:
Displaying numbers like $0.00000182 can feel confusing and technical for tradie users.

Fix:

    Add a toggle:

        [🧠 Show advanced pricing details]
        Hide these numbers by default.

    OR: Just state:

        “Your 1M free tokens go a long way — most tasks cost only a few tokens (a fraction of a cent).”

📉 3. Misleading Valuation of 1M Tokens

Location:
➡️ Same Token Modal → “1M tokens (full allocation)” shows: $40,000.00 NZD

Problem:
That figure is not just incorrect — it’s damaging. It creates confusion around value and pricing.

Fix:

    Remove that price entirely.

    Replace with a clear label like:

        ✅ Includes 1M tokens free with your demo.

📜 4. Guided Tour Still Uses Inaccurate Tone

Location:
➡️ Guided Tour → Step 5 of 15 (“Your Tokens = Your AI Power”)

Problem:

    While the tone is generally okay, there’s no mention of actual token cost or clarity that 1M tokens = practically unlimited use during demo.

Fix:

    Add reassurance here:

        “You’ve got 1 million free tokens to try everything. Most tasks only cost a few tokens — so you won’t run out.”

🔄 5. Missing Scroll or Collapse on Modal

Location:
➡️ Token Modal (main dashboard)

Problem:

    On smaller screens, there’s no scrolling or collapse, so content can get cut off.

Fix:

    Enable vertical scrolling in modal.

    Collapse long pricing info or add “Show More” toggle if necessary.

Let me know if you'd like me to test anything post-update. Thanks — these fixes will go a long way in improving user trust and clarity.
