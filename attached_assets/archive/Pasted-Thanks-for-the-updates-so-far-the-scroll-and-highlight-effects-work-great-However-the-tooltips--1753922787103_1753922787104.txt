Thanks for the updates so far ‚Äî the scroll and highlight effects work great.

However, the tooltips are still fixed in the center of the screen, not anchored to the highlighted section like we want. This is breaking the visual flow and doesn‚Äôt feel like a real tour. Here's what needs to be changed:
üéØ Problem:

    ‚úÖ Tour scrolls and highlights the correct section

    ‚ùå But the tooltip floats in the center of the screen, unrelated to the section

    ‚ùå It doesn‚Äôt feel like the tooltip is introducing the actual UI element being discussed

    ‚ùå On smaller screens or variable card heights, this looks especially disconnected and confusing

‚úÖ Desired Outcome:

Each step of the tour should:

    Scroll to the element (already working ‚úÖ)

    Highlight the element (already working ‚úÖ)

    Attach the tooltip directly to the highlighted element, not the center of the screen ‚ùå

    Tooltip should include a directional arrow pointing to the target section (e.g., below/above/right/left of element)

    Tooltip should reposition automatically on screen resize and remain attached

üí° Suggested Implementation:

If we‚Äôre using React Joyride, use:

{
  target: '.ai-business-team',
  content: 'Meet your personal AI team ‚Äî real assistants that help you with money, marketing, legal, and goals.',
  placement: 'bottom',
  disableScrolling: false,
  spotlightPadding: 12,
  scrollOffset: 72, // for sticky header
  styles: {
    options: {
      arrowColor: '#fff',
    }
  }
}

If this is custom tour code, update your tooltip logic like this:

// Get element position
const rect = target.getBoundingClientRect();
tooltip.style.position = 'absolute';
tooltip.style.top = `${rect.bottom + window.scrollY + 12}px`; // bottom of element
tooltip.style.left = `${rect.left + window.scrollX}px`; // left aligned

Also:

    Use scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' }) before positioning

    Recalculate position on window resize and when the step changes

    Add .tooltip-arrow class to show a directional arrow

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria:

    Tooltip is visibly attached to each highlighted element

    It appears below or beside the section depending on screen space

    The arrow points directly to the element

    The tooltip no longer floats disconnected from the UI

Can you please apply this and confirm whether we‚Äôre using a library (like Joyride or Shepherd), or if we‚Äôre working with a custom system? That‚Äôll help make this final adjustment clean and precise. Thank you!
