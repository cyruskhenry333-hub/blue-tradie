Hey Replit team 👋

We’d like to restructure the Blue Tradie beta rollout using a 3-tier early access system for the first 100 users, followed by a waitlist system. Please implement the following logic and flows:
🚀 BETA STRATEGY: 3 TIERS (LIMITED TO FIRST 100 USERS)

Tier 1: Founding 25

    🔓 Lifetime access to Phase 1 features

    🔖 Tag: "Founding Member – Lifetime Access"

    🎯 Primary objective: high-trust users who help shape the product

    🧾 No future charges for Phase 1 access

Tier 2: Early Supporter (Next 35)

    ⏳ 12 months of free access to all Phase 1 features

    💸 Plus: 40% lifetime discount on any future paid plans

    🔖 Tag: "Early Supporter – 1 Year Free + Lifetime Discount"

Tier 3: Beta Tester (Final 40)

    ⏳ 3 months of free access to all Phase 1 features

    💸 Plus: 20% lifetime discount on any future paid plans

    🔖 Tag: "Beta Tester – 3 Months Free + Lifetime Discount"

🧠 UX + FUNCTIONALITY TO IMPLEMENT

    Smart Tier Assignment

        System automatically assigns users to a tier based on how many spots are left (1–100).

        Auto-advances once a tier is filled (e.g., from Founding to Early Supporter).

        Each tier should show a live progress bar or counter (e.g. “18/25 Founding Spots Taken”).

    Custom Tier Messaging

        After sign-up, users see a custom confirmation message based on their tier.

        Add tier-specific badges/labels on the user dashboard (and optionally in emails).

    Timer Logic

        Tier 2 and Tier 3 free trial clocks should start from the full public launch date, not the signup date.

        Please ensure the trial countdown is triggered only after we mark the product as “live.”

    Waitlist After 100 Users

        Once 100 users are onboarded, redirect new signups to a simple waitlist landing page.

        Collect name and email (optional: ask “Why do you want early access?”).

        Add admin visibility for managing waitlist entries.

    Lifetime Discount Logic

        Ensure Tier 2 and Tier 3 users are tagged with their lifetime discount (40% or 20%).

        System should apply their discount automatically at checkout, for any future paid plans.

        Let us know if this is better handled manually via Stripe or can be built into the app’s logic.

🔧 Admin + Monitoring Needs

    Admin dashboard should show:

        Real-time count of users in each tier

        Waitlist entries (sortable/exportable if possible)

    Optional: ability to manually reassign users between tiers (e.g. promote a user to Founding tier)

❓Open Questions for Replit

    Can we delay trial start for Tier 2 & 3 until launch date?

    Can lifetime discounts be embedded into user accounts or checkout logic?

    Should the waitlist trigger an automated onboarding flow once spots reopen or product launches?

    Do you see any technical risks or improvements to this rollout structure?

Let us know once implemented — and if you need tier-specific copy or onboarding banners, we’re happy to provide.

Thanks legends 💙🛠️
