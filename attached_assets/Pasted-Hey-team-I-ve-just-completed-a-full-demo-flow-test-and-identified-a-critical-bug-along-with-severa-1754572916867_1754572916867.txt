Hey team,

I’ve just completed a full demo flow test and identified a critical bug along with several UI/state sync issues. Here's the breakdown:
🔄 1. Onboarding Wizard Triggers After Re-login (Incorrect Behavior)

Steps to reproduce:

    Sign up via demo

    Complete onboarding (all checklist stages done)

    Sign out

    Sign back in

Expected:
User should be routed directly to /dashboard if isOnboarded === true

Actual:
User is incorrectly routed back through the onboarding flow, despite:

    isOnboarded: true is set in the DB and returned via API

    All onboarding data is visible once you reach the dashboard

Fix:
Update the login/redirection logic to properly check isOnboarded state on login, and skip onboarding if true.

🚫 Please do not create a new workaround, middleware, or split state logic. Just ensure existing isOnboarded check gates the wizard correctly.
📦 2. Missing “Back to Dashboard” Navigation

Issue:
When inside Jobs, Invoices, or Expenses pages, there’s no consistent way to return to the dashboard.

Fix:
Add a Back to Dashboard button on each page (recommended position: top-left), preferably using a shared component for DRYness.
📊 3. Dashboard Widgets Don’t Update After Actions

Issue:
Adding a Job, Expense, or Invoice does not update the dashboard cards (e.g., Today’s Jobs, This Week’s Expenses) unless manually refreshed.

Fix:
Ensure these widgets subscribe to or pull the latest data after creation events — likely needs a refetch() or state update trigger on success.
💰 4. Client Book “Total Value” Displays Incorrectly

Issue:
Total Value field at top-right is currently showing $00.000.00 regardless of added jobs/invoices.

Fix:
Check the data binding and formatting logic — likely an empty or misformatted sum. Confirm it's dynamically calculating from scheduled/invoiced job data.
⚠️ Final Notes:

    Please don’t make any new structural changes, assumptions, or logic rewrites unless explicitly confirmed.

    Only address the bugs outlined above.

    Simulate this as a real user with demo login to verify correct behavior.

    Once complete, confirm:

        Re-login skips onboarding

        Widgets sync immediately

        Navigation works as expected

        UI shows correct totals

Thanks — let me know once all resolved and deployed.
