Hey team — great progress on the last fixes, but after full re-testing I’ve identified additional issues that still need to be addressed.

Please read carefully and do not introduce new flows or workarounds unless confirmed with me first.
🚨 1. RE-LOGIN STILL BROKEN

Issue: After logging out and back in, I’m still being taken through the onboarding wizard, despite isOnboarded: true already set.

    ✅ Dashboard shows fully completed data

    ❌ Onboarding wizard reappears on login — this should be bypassed

    🔁 This issue still isn’t resolved — please retest with a real demo login and confirm auth state is respected

✏️ 2. EDIT FUNCTION MISSING (Jobs, Expenses, Invoices)

Expected: Any item created (job, invoice, or expense) should be editable via an “Edit” button.

Current: No edit capability exists — user must delete and recreate records.

✅ Please add “Edit” functionality for each record, or confirm if this was excluded intentionally.
If excluded, explain why — and do not implement a new solution without discussion.
✉️ 3. Invoices Can’t Be Sent

Expected: On the invoice view, there should be a button to send/share the invoice (email or downloadable link).

Current: No send function available.

❓Is this restricted because of demo login, or is the backend API not implemented?

→ Please confirm:

    Is there a /send-invoice endpoint?

    Are real users (non-demo) able to send invoices?

    If this is a placeholder, flag it clearly in the UI to avoid confusion.

🧩 4. Dashboard Quick Glance Logic Broken

    The “This Month” jobs card shows 0, even though 2 jobs are scheduled today.

    “Today’s Jobs” and “This Week’s Expenses” sections show incomplete or outdated data.

    The “View All” button in the Today’s Jobs section doesn’t work (no routing/action).

✅ Please:

    Fix the logic to ensure “This Month” includes all current jobs (including today)

    Ensure all dashboard cards are synced with real-time data

    Confirm routing/actions for all “View All” buttons — simulate actual button clicks

⚠️ Final Note (Again):

Please DO NOT:

    Add new flows

    Rewrite business logic

    Add new placeholder data

    Patch silently

Unless you:

    Simulate the actual user journey

    Confirm the issue explicitly

    Check with me before applying anything not requested

Replit must simulate every single button, view, and action as a real user would — test buttons, routes, edits, deletes, state sync, and redirects.
✅ Please confirm once the following are fixed:

Re-login skips onboarding correctly

Edit function added to jobs, invoices, and expenses

Invoice send capability (or confirm why it’s disabled)

“This Month” jobs stat includes all jobs

“View All” button works in Today’s Jobs card

“This Week’s Expenses” displays real-time data

    All dashboard cards reflect current state correctly

Let me know once the fixes are deployed and tested end-to-end.

Thanks.
